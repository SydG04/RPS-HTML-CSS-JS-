# Rock Paper Scissors (Web Version)
Hello everyone!

## Description 
This project is an alternate version of my Python RPS game. Since I recently learned Javascript, I made a web version of my RPS game. 

## Goals
The goal of this project is to help me learn JavaScript. 

I am still in the VERY beginning stages. Logic has been added, but there are several features I am hoping to implement now or further in development: 

<ins>Simple tasks (implementation is very soon)</ins>: 
1. Get rid of choices after each time the user makes a choice (Unsure)
2. Add end game button after second round AND make it stay (in progress, current challenge)
3. Add texture to background (non-priority)

<ins>Advanced tasks (implementation is WAY in the future, usually after simple tasks are done)</ins>:
1. Have user input how many rounds they want or make it be endless
2. Add more than one background and give user the choice to change them
3. I want to change the icons to 8bit
4. Maybe make my own icons where I can have the User and Computer Icon react depending on if they won or not
