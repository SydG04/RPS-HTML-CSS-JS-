# Rock Paper Scissors (Web Version)
Hello everyone!

This project is an alternate version of my Python RPS game. Since I recently learned Javascript, I made a web version of my RPS game. 
The goal of this project is to help me learn JavaScript. 

I am still in the VERY beginning stages. It still needs logic.
